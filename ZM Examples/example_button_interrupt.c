*
* @brief Toggles LED0 when button pressed.
* 
* Configures pin controlling LED0 and LED1 to be an output. Configures pin attached to button as an input with interrupt. 
* Once per second toggles LED0 as a simple indication that application is running.
* When interrupt generated, waits to allow button to debounce then if button pressed, toggles LED0.
*
* This example is a good way to verify that the development environment is configured correctly.
*
* This example makes use of function pointers in the HAL file. 
* These get called by the appropriate ISR in the HAL file when the appropriate interrupt is fired. 
* To use a function pointer:
* - Declare it in this file:              extern void (*buttonIsr)(void);
* - Assign it to your local function      buttonIsr = &handleButtonPress;
* Now, whenever the button is pressed, your local handleButtonPress() method will be called.
