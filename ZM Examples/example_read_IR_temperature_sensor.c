 *
 * @brief Uses the I2C interface to read the external IR temperature sensor.
 *
 * @note Due to software averaging / transient reduction, the first four values are not valid
 * @note Requires a larger than default stack size on some processors. Uses ~180B on MSP430.
 *
 * @see http://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/tmp006
 *
 * Uses the Hardware Abstraction Layer (hal).
