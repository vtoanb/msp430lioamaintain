*
* @brief Resets Module, gets MAC Address
*
* Configures the processor to communicate with the module, resets the module, and uses the
* ZB_GET_DEVICE_INFO command to get the MAC address.
*
* ZB_DEVICE_INFO can be used to obtain valuable information about the operation of Module. Some
* fields like DIP_MAC_ADDRESS are valid all the time but the Zigbee network information like
* DIP_SHORT_ADDRESS is only valid once the Module has joined a network successfully. Note that all
* values returned from the module are Least Significant Byte (LSB) first. This example demonstrates
* how to flip the byte order so that the correct value is displayed.
*
* These device information properties are useful for debugging. When troubleshooting a connection
* problem, read DIP_STATE as it will give you an indication of what the Module is doing and whether
* it is on a network. Also it is handly to display all DIPs after the Module has joined the network.
*
* @note throughout the Module, data is always sent/received  with least significant byte first.
* For example, if sending data 0x01020304 then you would send byte 0x04 first and 0x01 last. This is
* why we swap the byte order of the MAC address in this example.
