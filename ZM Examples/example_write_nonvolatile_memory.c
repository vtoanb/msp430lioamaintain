 * @brief Resets Module, prompts the user for which NV item to write (1-6) and writes test data to that location.
 *
 * The Module supports six NV storage buffers (named "NV Items"). 1-4 are 2 bytes each; 5 & 6 are 16 bytes each.
 * These NV items are stored in the Module's flash memory and can be used for non-volatile storage.
