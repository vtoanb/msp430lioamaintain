 *
 * @brief Simple utility to demonstrate how to measure module current using onboard current sense
 * amplifier. To generate sufficient current to measure we turn the module on and off using its RF
 * Test functionality.
 *
 * @note the current sense amplifier cannot be used to measure module sleep current; you'll need a
 * precision micro-amperemeter since sleep current is ~10uA. See Basic Communications - End Device for
 * information about measuring sleeping current consumption.
