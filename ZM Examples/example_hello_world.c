 *
 * @brief Outputs "Hello World" to console and toggles LED approximately once per second.
 *
 * Configures the debug console UART pins and LED pin accordingly; loops and outputs text.
 *
 * If you aren't seeing the message:
 * - Verify that hardware is installed correctly:
 *       Open the Device Manager: Go to Start : Run... type in devmgmt.msc and press Return.
 *       Then click on the + symbol next to ports. Note the COM port number next to the ez430 board.
 * - Verify that your terminal program is configured correctly:
 *       If using HyperTerminal, open the Device Manager: Go to Start : Run... type in hypertrm.exe and press Return.
 *       We recommend TeraTerm, as it is much better.
 * - Verify that the COM port number is correct and the baud rate and other configuration is correct.
 * - Verify that the application is running - verify that LED is blinking.
 * - Verify that the application is outputting bytes on the serial port:
 *       Use an oscilloscope to probe the microcontroller's Tx pin and verify that the UART is working.
 * - Using the debugger, stop the processor and see where it stops. It normally should halt in SysCtlDelay().
