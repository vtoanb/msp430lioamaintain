 * @brief Resets Radio, gets module version information using SYS_VERSION command and displays it.
 *
 * Configures the application processor to communicate with the radio, resets the radio, and sends the
 * SYS_VERSION command and parses the received response and displays it to the console.
 * Demonstrates basic request-response functionality of the module.
 *
 * @note these fields should not be all zeroes. If you're only seeing zeroes then you may have a bug.
 * Typical values seen are <i>Version: TransportRev=2, ProductId=126, FW Rev=2.5.1</i>
