*
* @brief Common message header
*
* This is a message header that has the basics:
* - MAC Address
* - Protocol Version
* - Flags
* - Sequence Number
*
* Of course you will probably want to change this header format for your own use, but this format
 * works fairly well for most projects. The MAC Address is included to make it easier when the
 * message is converted into an Ethernet packet; the Protocol Version allows you to change protocols
 * in the future; the flags are for generic use; and the Sequence Number is handy when you have lots
 * of sequential data and you need to re-order it on the server side.
