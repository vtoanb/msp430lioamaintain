 *
 * @brief Resets Module, reads out the contents of all user non-volatile (NV) items and displays to console.
 *
 * The Module supports six NV storage buffers (named "NV Items"). 1 through 4 are 2 bytes each; 5 & 6 are 16 bytes each.
 * These NV items are stored in the Module's flash memory and can be used for non-volatile storage.
 * To verify, run the Write NV Items example, power cycle the Module, and then run this example.
 * You should see that the values are retained through loss of power.
