 *
 * @brief Resets Module, parses message received and displays to console.
 *
 * Configures the microcontroller to communicate with the Module, asserts the Module's RESET line,
 * and then receives the SYS_RESET_IND message sent from the Module.
 *
 * If this isn't working correctly:
 * - Verify that CFG pins are set correctly.
 * - Verify that nothing else is connected to the RESET line, like an external programmer or debugger.
 * - Run the Hello World application to verify that the console is working.
 * - If all else fails, attach a logic analyzer and look at the traffic to/from the module. Compare with example traces.
 *
 * @note The Module can be reset through hardware (the RESET pin) or software (SYS_RESET_REQ).
 * It is highly recommended to use the hardware reset instead of the software reset.
 * @note This application is the foundation of all radio examples. If porting these examples to another processor,
 * get this example working before attempting any of the other radio examples.
