 * @brief Resets Module, configures all four of the GPIO pins as inputs with pullups, then reads out
 * the value of these pins to console once per second, between 0x00 (all low) to 0x0F (all high).
 * To test, start this application then connect one or more GPIO pins to GND.
 * You will see the value change accordingly.
 *
 * The Module supports four General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. Pins can be individually configured as:
 * - Inputs
 * - Outputs
 * - Tri-State
 * When configured as an input, the pin can be configured with a pull-up resistor or pull-down resistor.
