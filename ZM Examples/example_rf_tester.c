 *
 * @brief Simple utility to configure the Module to output an RF test signal.
 *
 * Configures Module interface, resets module, and then processes typed commands.
 * The Module can output either an RF carrier signal, or random modulated data.
 * The user can change which test mode to use, channel (11-26), and turn off the transmitter.
 * This utility can be used for radiated emissions compliance testing or tuning the RF circuit.
 *
 * The Utility can be controlled through the simple command-line menu. Commands:
 *     ]   Increment RF Test Channel
 *     [   Increment RF Test Channel
 *     M   Change RF Test Mode to modulated output
 *     U   Change RF Test Mode to UNmodulated output
 *     R   Change RF Test Mode to receive (Turn off output)
 *     !   Reset Module
 *     ?   Print this menu
 *
 * If, instead, you would like it to output one particular mode on startup, change
 * <code>rfTestMode</code> and <code>rfTestChannel</code> accordingly.
