/**
* @file application_configuration.c
*
* @brief Contains Zigbee Application Configuration methods. 
*
* An Application Configuration defines how the Module will function on the Zigbee Network. This
* includes which profile is used, which endpoints are used, whether you want binding, etc.
* This is used by both Simple API and AFZDO to configure the Module for the particular application.
* Simple API can register one applicationConfiguration.
* AFZDO can register multiple applicationConfigurations, each having its own endpoint.
* Refer to documentation for more information.
* @note if using Simple API, the method sapiRegisterGenericApplication() does most of what you need.
* @note if using AF, the method afRegisterGenericApplication() does most of what you need.
* @note binding is unsupported.
* @note to configure a Coordinator with one binding input cluster 0x0001, then configure the ac with:
 -  ac.numberOfBindingInputClusters =   1; 
 -  ac.bindingInputClusters[0] =        0x0001;    
 -  ac.numberOfBindingOutputClusters =  0;   
*
* @note to configure a Router with one binding output cluster 0x0001, then configure the ac with:
 -  ac.numberOfBindingInputClusters =   0;   
 -  ac.numberOfBindingOutputClusters =  1;
 -  ac.bindingOutputClusters[0] =       0x0001;
