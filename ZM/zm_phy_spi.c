/**
* @file zm_phy_spi.c
*
* @brief Physical Interface Layer to the Module using the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) port.
* This file acts as an interface between the module library methods and the hardware (hal file).
* 
* @note To output SPI transmit information, define ZM_PHY_SPI_VERBOSE.
* It is recommended to define this on a per-project basis. 
* In IAR, this can be done in Project Options : C/C++ compiler : Preprocessor
* In the defined symbols box, add:
* ZM_PHY_SPI_VERBOSE
*
* Normally the module is quite fast in responding to a SREQ and there is not sufficient time on a 
* slower processor (e.g. < 25MHz) to configure a timeout to detect a missing response. If using a 
* fast processor then define FAST_PROCESSOR. This does several things:
*   1. sendSreq() will timeout if a response was not received in time. 
*   2. the amount of time spent in each part of the SREQ process is available in variables 
*       timeFromChipSelectToSrdyLow and timeWaitingForSrsp.
