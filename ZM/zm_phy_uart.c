/**
* @file zm_phy_uart.c
*
* @brief Physical Interface Layer to the Module using the Universal Asynchronous 
* Receiver/Transmitter interface.
* This file acts as an interface between the module library methods and the hardware (hal file).
* 
* @note To output SPI transmit information, define ZM_PHY_UART_VERBOSE.
* It is recommended to define this on a per-project basis. 
* In IAR, this can be done in Project Options : C/C++ compiler : Preprocessor
* In the defined symbols box, add:
* ZM_PHY_UART_VERBOSE
*
* @section Troubleshooting
* Module UART requires 115,200 kbs, with flow control enabled. Most problems with
* the UART interface are caused by flow control errors, so check these first.
*
* @section Concurrency
* To prevent code in two places accessing the messageBuffer at the same time, we use a mutex.
* This mutex is implemented as a bit flag in the messageFlags variable. Accessing the mutex is through
* a spinlock, which waits until the buffer becomes available before using it. For example:
<pre>
  while (messageFlags & MESSAGE_BUFFER_IN_USE);   //wait for msgBuffer to be available
  messageFlags |= MESSAGE_BUFFER_IN_USE;          //lock the buffer
</pre>

Message processing is handled according to a simple state machine. If a message 
has already started, then append bytes to messageBuffer. When a byte is received:
1. Assert RTS so that the module doesn't send another byte while we're processing this one
2. Set messageFlags.MESSAGE_BUFFER_IN_USE. This is a simple mutex to control 
access to messageBufferIndex, messageBuffer, and fcs to prevent concurrency issues
3. Process received byte based on the state of messageBufferState
4. Clear messageFlags.MESSAGE_BUFFER_IN_USE mutex
5. Deassert RTS to allow more bytes to be received
@param c the byte that was received in the ISR.
