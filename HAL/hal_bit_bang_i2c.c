*
* @brief Software I2C interface. Contains individual methods (start/stop/in/out) as well as full methods (read, write) etc.
*
* Uses the Hardware Abstraction Layer (hal).
*
* I2C Notes:
* - I2C direction bit is the last bit of the address byte, right before ACK bit. ZERO indicates a 
* write to the slave and ONE indicates a read from the slave. After the direction bit and 
* ACKNOWLEDGE, master will send the data to the slave or read data from the slave depending on the 
* direction. The data transfer will be terminated when master sets STOP condition on the bus.
* - According to the I2C standard, when communicating on bus the master never outputs a logic high. 
* It only pulls the bus down. Logic high is set by allowing external pull-ups to pull the bus up.
