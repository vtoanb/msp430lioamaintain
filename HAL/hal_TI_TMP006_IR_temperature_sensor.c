@note this may cause a stack overflow condition! Mind your stack size! In CCS the stack size is
configured in Project Properties : Build : ARM Linker : Basic Options. On an MSP430 this can cause
stack usage of ~180B; we configure stack size for 200B or more. On Stellaris we use 1024B. Obviously
these settings are much larger than the default.
